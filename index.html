        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Machine learning in healthcare is complicated by the inherently sequential nature of medical decision-making. Each intervention addresses immediate needs and simultaneously influences subsequent choices and outcomes. For example, in treating sepsis, a physician may need to adjust supportive therapies or shift from broad-spectrum to targeted antibiotics as the patient's condition evolves. While causal inference and reinforcement learning have been used to solve similar challenges, these approaches often fail to address the unique demands of healthcare. Policies must account for uncertainty, generalize across various hospitals and patient demographics, and be interpretable to healthcare providers. Furthermore, because experimentation is often risky, unethical, or prohibitively expensive, clinically useful approaches must both learn from and be evaluated using retrospective healthcare data. Importantly, policies derived from offline datasets must not only improve upon clinician treatment plans but also align closely with current practices. We must therefore develop methods specifically tailored to accommodate healthcareâ€™s complexities.</p> 
        <p>This workshop will convene researchers committed to improving machine learning methods designed to solve sequential decision making problems in healthcare, with the goal of facilitating their use in real-world clinical settings.</p>
